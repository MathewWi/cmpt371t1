= High Level Analysis =

== State of Project Build ==

Currently the project builds a binary and runs a sample program. 

The application can be loaded onto an Android phone and run the same as on the AVD.  

There is also a simple and as of yet incomplete smoke test implemented and can be run to ensure project quality before commit.

== Features Implemented ==

Build completes.

Program runs correctly.

Loads the grid play area, as well as multiple boxes and spheres to represent a level.

Touch features such as pinch and swipe work well.  Some refinement may still need to be done.

== Features to Be Implemented ==

Touch screen GUI - currently started, but incomplete.

Enhanced graphics - simple graphics currently implemented.

Full audio capabilities.

100+ levels.

Random level generator.

== STI/Defect Information ==

Currently there are no STI's or defects within the code itself, as everything is only stubbed out.
