#summary Outline of the requirements for Milestone 2
<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Code Requirements =
 == Source Code Repository ==
  Source code for Luminance for this milestone can be found here:
  [http://code.google.com/p/cmpt371t1/source/checkout]
 == Daily Build ==
  A daily build is run on !TeamCity to ensure the continuing quality of the software.  It sends and email to every group member when there is an unsuccessful build.  It also prevents committing of code that breaks the build.  This is riding on the notion of fixing bugs on existing functionality before continuing development.
 == Smoke Test, Testing and Hooks ==

= Initial Analysis for Deliverable 3 =
 == Deliverable plan ==
 Any project artifacts that were modified or created since the first milestone will be part of Deliverable 3.

  The following new artifacts are anticipated:

   * Version Control Strategy - How to ensure that developers do not commit code that will compromise the build.
   * GUI Test Suite - Continuing work with Robotium.
   * jUnit Test Suite - Continuing work with the unit test suite.
   * jCoverage Test Suite - The code coverage test suite.
   * Software Quality - The latest measurements of quality using code reviews.

  In addition, the following implementation-specific tasks are anticipated:
   * Alpha Version Complete - A working alpha version of the game should be complete.
   * Level Format - The game level format will be analyzed and implemented.
   * Sounds, special effects, lighting complete.
   * Multiple levels.
   * Random level generator.
   * Game Level Editor - A tool to create new game levels.
