#summary - General startup for test/triage group
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

To all in the test and triage (should they be together?)
We need to come up with some basic formatting on how to present
or fill in bug reports, error handling, test cases, and whatnot.
Essentially any basics that need filling in.

Just list some ideas or post links so there is a general grasp of
what a good way to start with is.

P.S. Anyone can participate if they have any knowledge or prior 
experience in the matter.

= Updates =
Will also need to discuss times when our sub groups can meet
  This can be discussed here on the wiki or give phones numbers
  and text or whatnot.

= Details =
