#summary Outline of how to set up the development environment.

= Introduction =

Everyone should try to use the same development environment unless you have a good reason not to. You'll need Eclipse, the Android SDK, and the Eclipse ADT plugin.

*TODO: fill in some additional information below.*

= Eclipse =
[http://www.eclipse.org]

Classic Eclipse should work fine.

= Android SDK =
[http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]

Within the AVD manager tool, you'll need to install at least the following for version 2.1 (API version 7) and maybe 2.2 (API version 8):
*Android SDK
*Android SDK Platform-tools
*Documentation for Android SDK
*SDK Platform

Once those are installed, create an AVD.

= ADT Plugin =
[http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html]

Point Eclipse to the directory you installed the SDK into. This is the Window menu.
