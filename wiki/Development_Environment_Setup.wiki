#summary Outline of how to set up the development environment.

= Introduction =
Everyone should try to use the same development environment unless you have a good reason not to. You'll need Eclipse, the Android SDK, the Eclipse !TeamCity plugin, and the Eclipse ADT plugin.

= Get the tools =
==Eclipse==
[http://www.eclipse.org]

Classic Eclipse should work fine.

== Java JDK ==
You must download the Java JDK:
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]

 - If you download 64bit JDK sometimes the Android SDK installer won't recognize it.  Just install the 32bit JDK.

==Android SDK==

===Downloading the Android SDK===
  # Download the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android SDK] for your particular platform.
  # If you're on Windows, install the SDK by running the downloaded executable. If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, unarchive the package and resulting SDK in a safe place. Note the location.


==ADT Plugin==

===Installation===
  # Go to Eclipse's Help menu and select Install New Software...
  # In the resulting window click on the Add... button and add this URL, https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/, to the Location field. Name it whatever you want and click OK. Note: If Eclipse tells you that it's a duplicate location, you can skip this step.
  # Make sure that the site you entered in the previous step is selected in the "Work with" field. If it isn't click on the down arrow at the end of the field and click on the site you added.
  # You should now see a Developer Tools entry in the table in the center. You can click on the disclosure triangle to view the contents if you want, but we're going to install it all anyway. Just click on the checkbox beside "Developer Tools" and click Next. Follow the on-screen instructions and restart Eclipse when it prompts you to and you will have finished installing the ADT plugin for Eclipse.

===Configuration===
  # Go to Eclipse's preferences and select in the left pane.
  # By the SDK Location field, click on the Browse... button.
  # Find the location that you location that you placed the Android SDK and select that.

===Adding Platforms and Components===
  # In Eclipse, go to Window > Android SDK and AVD Manager.
  # In the left pane, select Available packages.
  # Check off SDK Platform Android 2.1 and 2.2. Also check off "Android SDK Tools, revision 8", "Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 1" and "Documentation for Android SDK, API 9, revision 1"

===Make AVD (Android Virtual Device)===
  # Name the device whatever you want.
  # Choose Android 2.1-update1 - API Level 7
  # Leave the SD Card section blank
  # For the "Built-in" choose Default (HVGA) and click Create AVD.


==UML Diagram Plugin==
*ObjectAid UML Explorer for Eclipse*

In eclipse, go to Help->Install New Software. Click "Add" to add a site to get updates from and use the address [http://www.objectaid.com].
_This is the UML tool that I found easy to use, I would suggest this UML tool unless anyone has a better tools for this._


==!TeamCity Plugin==
In eclipse, go to Help->Install New Software. Click "Add" to add a site to get updates from and use the address [http://pp00505600136c.usask.ca/update/eclipse] in the location field. Select the "!JetBrains !TeamCity Plugin", click next, and go through the dialogs that come up.

Now that the plugin is installed, go to the menu "!TeamCity->Login", use the address [http://pp00505600136c.usask.ca/] and enter your username/password. Don't use the "tc.zenja.ca" address here.

= Configure Eclipse for !TeamCity =
After much of frustration, it's become evident that !TeamCity will not do all the SVN for you seamlessly. You need to make sure that Subversive is installed in Eclipse first. I believe it's supposed to be installed by default, but Google about how to install it using the Eclipse update system if not. At some point you'll probably have to choose a "connector" for subversive - use the SVNKit 1.3.3 connector. My install was kind of messed up and getting this working was tedious, so I won't document it here - just ask me if you have trouble.

Now to get the project into Eclipse, you'll have to create a new project from SVN. Go to File->New->Other and under the SVN folder choose "Project from SVN". Create a new repository location using "https://cmpt371t1.googlecode.com/svn/" as the location, and use your Google username and password for authentication. Your password isn't the same as your email password. You can find it under your Google profile settings page which you can reach from the Google Code project page at the top right of the page. Click finish. Now choose the "Find projects in the children of the selected resource" option, click finish, and complete the rest of the screens, choosing to create the new project in the existing workspace, naming the project Luminance.

To commit changes, use the !TeamCity->Remote Run menu option.
