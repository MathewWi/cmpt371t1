#summary Outline of how to set up the development environment.

= Introduction =

Everyone should try to use the same development environment unless you have a good reason not to. You'll need Eclipse, the Android SDK, the Eclipse TeamCity plugin, and the Eclipse ADT plugin.

*TODO: fill in some additional information below.*

==Eclipse==
[http://www.eclipse.org]

Classic Eclipse should work fine.

==Android SDK==
[http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]

Within the AVD manager tool, you'll need to install at least the following for version 2.1 (API version 7) and maybe 2.2 (API version 8):
  * Android SDK
  * Android SDK Platform-tools
  * Documentation for Android SDK
  * SDK Platform

Once those are installed, create an AVD.

==ADT Plugin==
[http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html]

Point Eclipse to the directory you installed the SDK into. This is the Window menu.

==TeamCity Plugin==
In eclipse, go to "Help->Install New Software". Click "Add" to add a site to get updates from and use the address [http://pp00505600136c.usask.ca/update/eclipse] in the location field with the name TeamCity. Select the "JetBrains TeamCity Plugin", click next, and go through the dialogs that come up.

Now that the plugin is installed, go to the menu "TeamCity->Login", use the address [http://pp00505600136c.usask.ca/] and enter your username/password. Don't use the "tc.zenja.ca" address here.
