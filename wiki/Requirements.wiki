#summary Requirements for this project to succeed

= User Requirements =
  * Fun factor
   Perhaps an obvious statement but a very important part of a game none the less.  Measuring fun is not easy and is beyond the scope of this project.  However through some user evaluation and general feedback we will determine the fun factor and do what we can to increase it.

  * Quick load time
   Always an important requirement to users.  This is exacerbated by the fact this will be running on a phone.  The user is going to expect the application to launch in a time comparable to other applications.

  * Graphics
   The game should have decent graphics.  This includes some neat special effects (lighting, reflections, particles).  Not only is this a user requirement it is a selling point for any game.
  * Intuitive Input Interface
  * Effective sound effects
  * responsive control
  * not crash
  * save, load
  * potential networking stuff

= Functional Requirements =
  * Platform Compatibility (2.1 above)
  * Must have touchscreen (at least initially, we plan to port it as much as we can)
  * Might support keyboard
  * Portability
  * Distribution
