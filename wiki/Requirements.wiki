#summary Requirements for this project to succeed

= User Requirements =
  * Fun factor
   Perhaps an obvious statement but a very important part of a game none the less.  Measuring fun is not easy and is beyond the scope of this project.  However through some user evaluation and general feedback we will determine the fun factor and do what we can to increase it.

  * Quick load time
   Always an important requirement to users.  This is exacerbated by the fact this will be running on a phone.  The user is going to expect the application to launch in a time comparable to other applications.

  * Graphics
   The game should have decent graphics.  This includes some neat special effects (lighting, reflections, particles).  Not only is this a user requirement it is a selling point for any game.

  * Intuitive Input Interface
   The input interface should be clean and utilize the perceived affordances people already have for touch screen input usage.  For users who do not enjoy a touch interface we can utilize the pointer and keyboard as well.

  * Effective sound effects
   The sounds effects in the game should be minimal but effective.  Each important action should carry a unique sound effect.  Since we are on a phone we also need to make sure that without sound the game is still able to convey feedback information.

  * Responsive control
   The input interface should be very responsive.  There should be a minimal delay (<100ms) of processing the input a user makes and the user noticing the change.

  * Graceful termination on exception
   The application if encountering a critical error should attempt a graceful termination.  The users progress in the game should be preserved if possible.

  * Never crash the phone
   The game cannot bring the whole phone down.  This type of error cannot be allowed to persist.  The product will not pass Q&A if there is a way it can crash the phone.
  
  * Saving and Loading
   Users will want to save their progress and load from where they left off.  A puzzle game such as this is expected to be played in small spurts.  The saving and loading process should be transparent.

  * potential networking stuff

= Functional Requirements =
  * Platform Compatibility (2.1 above)
  * Must have touchscreen (at least initially, we plan to port it as much as we can)
  * Might support keyboard
  * Portability
  * Distribution
