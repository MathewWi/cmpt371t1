== Test Cases:==

	*Light to obstacle collision
	*Object interaction/function
	*Object to obstacle collision
	*User statistics registration
	*User transition between states, saved menu, resume
	*System under stress
	
== Functional Requirements: ==

	*Light to orb connection
	*Light to mirror connection
	*White Light to prism refraction
	*Mirror rotation
	*Erasor functionality
	*User time record
	*Sound effects/BG music
