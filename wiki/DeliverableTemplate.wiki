#summary Outline of the requirements for Milestone 1
<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Code Requirements =
== Source Code Repository ==
Source code for Luminance can be found here:
[http://code.google.com/p/cmpt371t1/source/checkout]

== Daily Build ==
A daily build is run on !TeamCity to ensure the continuing quality of the software.  It sends and email to every group member when there is an unsuccessful build.  It also prevents committing of code that breaks the build.  This is riding on the notion of fixing bugs on existing functionality before continuing development.
== Smoke Test, Testing and Hooks ==

All testing documentation can be viewed here: TestPlan

= Mini-Milestone List =

= Requirements =
== Functional ==
Development environment requirements can be viewed here: DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup

Stephen will add more

== Non-functional == 
User requirements can be viewed at: UserRequirements

= GUI Prototype =
A video of the previous implementation of the game can be viewed here: [http://code.google.com/p/cmpt371t1/]

Our ported version is meant to mimic the user interface of this very closely.

Here are some pictures of how our user interface will look with the touch screen functionality: http://code.google.com/p/cmpt371t1/wiki/GUIPrototypes

= Initial Analysis for Deliverable 2 =
== Deliverable plan ==

- all project artifacts created or modified since the first milestone

- new artifacts: 
  * updated risk analysis (including results of new scanning)
  * the version control strategy
  * basic GUI test suite
  * jUnit test suite
  * jCoverage test suite
  * the latest measurements of software quality
  * game level editor

- game level format analyzed and implemented

- alpha version of game completed
