= Use Cases =

* User Procedure Name*  First Level Walk-through

New player walks through the first level of game

* Scope*  Luminance

* Level*  user-goal

* Primary Actor*  New player

* Stakeholders and Interests* 

_ _

_New Player:_ Wants to learn how to play the game decides to walk-through the tutorial.

_Tester:_ Wants to run the new player script for playing the first level of the game to check for possible issues.

_Developer: _Wants to run the new player script to see what functionalities of the game can be improved.

* Preconditions* :

   Walk-through map is created e.g. Luminance video 1:03.

                                    Map rules:

                                                One light beam

                                                3 differing colored circles

                                                At least one wall obstacle impeding direct access to circle

                                                Top wall, bottom wall

                                                A solution

                                                Only 1 prism

                                                Background music plays

                                                On completion success music plays

                                                Multiple instances of mirrors, based on difficulty

                                                Infinite eraser

                                                Able to change orientation, camera focuses on centre

* Success Guarantee* 

The player splits the beam of white light into primary colors and redirects them into the primary colors and redirects them into colored goals using mirrors. Success music plays and the user is given the option menu and their time of completion.

* Special Requirements* 

  -No special requirements

* Technology and Data Variations*  * List* 

  -No technology or data variations

* Frequency of Occurrence* 

  -frequent all players will play through the first level.

* Miscellaneous* 

Actors:

Prereq:	Map is started

Test Data:	

	(post map grid here)
	
Steps:			

		# User starts game
			# Android's Luminance memory is reduced
		# User chooses first level play through tutorial
			# Android slowly reduces memory for Luminance to 0
				* Luminance system realizes memory is too low returns error exits
			# Android's Luminance memory is reset to normal
			# Android's hard drive space is set to very low
		# User starts game
		# User chooses first level play through tutorial
