#summary Results of code reviews we've done so far.

= Personal Code Reviews =
Personal code reviews were done on team members own time.  The process was to review code that was not written by them, and log issues they saw here.

== Martina ==

  * Box.java:
    * Line 36: Why are values hard coded for rotation?

  * !GameObject.java: 
    * Lines 70-78: Commented out code.  Is this still needed?  If not, delete it.

  * Grid.java: 
    * Line 79, 107, 302, 306, 317: Commented out code.
    * Line 82: Not very clear what this loop does.  Consider adding comment.

  * Mirror.java:
    * Lines 29 and 30: Why are these values hard coded?  

  * !SkyBox.java:
    * Lines 75, 81, 87: Magic numbers.  What do these values represent?

* ALL IF STATEMENTS NEED BRACERS * 

Under all circumstances, please put braces around all if statements, regardless of how many lines they are. Please run Eclipse -> Project -> Source -> Format on your files before commit.

* !ResourceManager() *

The word resource should not appear in the function names, since it is a ResourceManager.  Something like loadTexture() is more appropriate. The AudioManager is separate but an instance will be maintained by Engine and talked to by resourceManager via the engine.


* !InputSystem() *

The scaleX, scaleY was not being set correctly, Luminance.java should calculate the proper values like ReplicaIsland does and pass it on to Engine deviceChagne.


* GUI() *

Keep class names generic, add a Interface (IWidget).  Here is a helpful link: (http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=2D_using_OpenGL) it is for OpenGL but most applies to OpenGL ES (except the glVertex() calls, see Box/SkyBox for how to translate it to OpenGL ES).


* Renderer() *

Should be a container for renderable objects, will manage matrix multiplications and then ask objects to render themselves.


* !PrimitiveSphere() *

Should use a sphere generation algorithm (this is a classic 3D problem and task given to students). Here is a long OpenGL version I wrote for my summer work last year in IMG Lab. Convert to OpenGL ES fairly easily. Although it uses QUAD_STRIPS which are a bit slower (TRIANGLE_STRIP is the fastest by far). The hardest part of these algorithms is making sure texture coords wrap properly.

`void drawSphere(double r, int lats, int longs)`

`{`

`int i, j;`

`for(i = 0; i <= lats; i++)`

`{`

`double lat0 = PI * (-0.5 + (double) (i - 1) / lats);`

`double z0 = sin(lat0);`

`double zr0 = cos(lat0);`

`double lat1 = PI * (-0.5 + (double) i / lats);`

`double z1 = sin(lat1);`

`double zr1 = cos(lat1);`

`double tx1 = 0;`

`double ty1 = 0;`

`double tx2 = 0;`

`double ty2 = 0;`

`glBegin(GL_QUAD_STRIP);`

`for(j = 0; j <= longs; j++)`

`{`

`double lng = 2 * PI * (double) (j - 1) / longs;`

`double x = cos(lng);`

`double y = sin(lng);`

`tx1 = atan2(x * zr0, z0) / (2. * PI) + 0.5;`

`ty1 = asin(y * zr0) / PI + .5;`

`if(tx1 < 0.75 && tx2 > 0.75)`

`{`

`tx1 += 1.0;`

`}`

`else if(tx1 > 0.75 && tx2 < 0.75)`

`{`

`tx1 -= 1.0;`

`}`

`tx2 = atan2(x * zr1, z1) / (2. * PI) + 0.5;`

`ty2 = asin(y * zr1) / PI + .5;`

`if(tx2 < 0.75 && tx1 > 0.75)`

`{`

`tx2 += 1.0;`

`}`

`else if(tx2 > 0.75 && tx1 < 0.75)`

`{`

`tx2 -= 1.0;`

`}`

`glTexCoord2f(tx1, ty1);`

`glNormal3f(x * zr0, y * zr0, z0);`

`glVertex3f(x * zr0 * r, y * zr0 * r, z0 * r);`

`glTexCoord2f(tx2, ty2);`

`glNormal3f(x * zr1, y * zr1, z1);`

`glVertex3f(x * zr1 * r, y * zr1 * r, z1 * r);`

`}`

`glEnd();`

=== Toolbelt.java ===
Line 26: _GRIDPOINT_ERROR - What is this? Needs to be made smaller.  Used as an epsilon for constraining floating point errors.

Line 30: Game state should not be a storage object.  It should be a container for all the other classes; act as a controller.  This causes coupling.  We should try to get this with the toolbelt not talking to game state.

Line 34: List of tools used to loop through to see objects on the grid.  Not necessary.  Be careful with usage.

Line 39 and 40: These are used to indicate a load of a button texture after the parsing of a level file.  Perhaps load all at startup instead of at runtime.
