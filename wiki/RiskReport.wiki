#summary Analysis of current and future risks for our project

= Abstract=
 This is a report outlining the major sources of risk from our project. Each risk will be noted along with the following relevant information:
  * Description - information about the risk being discussed
  * Priority - risks will be ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest risk, 5 being the highest)
  * Rationale - reasons why the issue is considered a risk
  * Mitigation Plan - how we plan to prevent this risk from being realized
  * Contingency Plan - should the risk occur, what alternatives can be explored?
  * Status - has the issue been resolved or are there still potential risk issues?

=Current Risks=
Below are risks that are most important to this phase of the project:

==Risk 1==
 * *Description:* Setting up !TeamCity to run a smoke test when code is committed.

 * *Priority:* 5

 * *Rationale:* Not having !TeamCity properly set up is a serious risk because without it there would be nothing to prevent team members from committing code that may compromise the main build. It is also needed to run our smoke test which will attempt to prevent this from occurring. Ultimately, we will be unable to work efficiently on this project without !TeamCity and our smoke test.

 * *Mitigation Plan:* We are confident that this issue can be resolved if the Build Master and the Test Team combine their knowledge to get both systems to work together.

 * *Contingency Plan:* Should the issue not be resolved in a timely manner, we plan to designate more team members to work on the issue until it is resolved. Our research has indicated that !TeamCity is the optimal choice for continuous integration, therefore other options will not be explored.

 * *Status:* Currently, the project builds successfully on !TeamCity and a simple smoke test is in place. Therefore, this risk is sufficiently avoided.

==Risk 2==
 * *Description:* Setting up a standard development environment for all developers.

 * *Priority:* 4

 * *Rationale:* It is crucial to have a standard development environment so that all users have an identical environment to ensure that errors do not result from 

 * *Mitigation Plan:* We plan to avoid the realization of this risk by proper use of our project wiki. We will provide detailed instructions on how to set up our chosen IDE as well as integration of all the required plugins.

 * *Contingency Plan:* If there are team members who are having issues setting up the standard development environment, we can delegate other team members who have been successful to help out those that are struggling.

 * *Status:* Several team members have already set up their development environments. In addition, we have published a page on our project wiki for the purpose of assisting those who have not yet completed the task. Therefore, this risk has been successfully managed.

==Risk 3==
 * *Description:* Ensuring proper team communication.

 * *Priority:* 5

 * *Rationale:* Without efficient communication, a project is susceptible to risk in many areas, including ones that are not yet known. It is important that all team members have access to current information about design, testing, group meetings, issue tracking, and any other issues that may come up.

 * *Mitigation Plan:* We have dealt with this risk by publishing any important information on the project wiki. In addition, a project mailing list should be set up for efficient communication among all team members.

 * *Contingency Plan:* We believe that the project wiki and group mailing list should be sufficient to facilitate proper communication within the team. If this is not acceptable, team members who are unsure of their current task and cannot find the information on the project wiki should contact the project lead for additional guidance.

 * *Status:* The project wiki is updated frequently with details concerning meeting minutes, individual tasks, and guides for setting up the systems needed to start development and testing. Therefore, this risk has been successfully managed.



=Potential Risks=

 These are risks that we may face in the future and need to be planned for:

==Risk 4==
 * *Description:* Ensuring touch support for Android will provide a positive user experience.

 * *Priority:* 3

 * *Rationale:* Since the original platform did not have touch support for its original input, it is crucial that the user experience is maintained in moving forward to the new platform.

 * *Mitigation Plan:* We plan to thoroughly research the capabilities of Android touch APIs. In addition, we hope to find sample code to use as a reference to assist in the implementation.

 * *Contingency Plan:* Should our research into Android APIs be unsuccessful, we will attempt to find a 3rd party solution. It is likely that this is a solved problem already. To facilitate proper communication, we will publish our findings to the project wiki for easy access.

 * *Status:* We have designated a member of our design team to research this issue, to ensure that it is solved before we encounter it.

==Risk 5==
 * *Description:* Code re-write from old platform to Android

 * *Priority:* 4

 * *Rationale:* This is the largest and most important task concerning this phase of the project. Re-writing the code for Android will be a time-consuming activity and is crucial for the project completion.

 * *Mitigation Plan:* Our project lead has in-depth experience with the old system, since he was one of the original developers. We are hoping to use this prior knowledge to create a stub framework so that the implementation can be divided into work units.

 * *Contingency Plan:* If there are still issues getting the code re-write completed, developers can seek the assistance of our project lead, and the issue will likely be resolved from there.

 * *Status:* We currently have a stub framework on our code repository and from there we plan to divide the development task into work units for developers to take on.

==Risk 6==
 * *Description:* Investigate how project resources are stored on Android

 * *Priority:* 3

 * *Rationale:* Since our project will be using external resources (audio, textures, etc.) we must be aware of where these items are stored in the compiled application. Without knowing these details, we would not be able to reference the resources correctly. 

 * *Mitigation Plan:* We have delegated a developer to begin research on this topic, and attempt to find documentation on the Android developer page. From there, we can post the relevant information to the project wiki.

 * *Contingency Plan:* If an individual developer working on this task is having issues, they will request assistance from another team member to work together until the task is completed.

 * *Status:* This issue is currently being researched.

==Risk 7==
 * *Description:* Avoid performance problems when running on Android phone

 * *Priority:* 3

 * *Rationale:* It is possible that a basic game session could run slowly, impacting the overall game experience. When a game suffers performance problems, it severely detracts from the game play regardless of how good it may be.

 * *Mitigation Plan:* If we do encounter performance issues, one possible solution is to decrease graphics quality for the in-game objects. This will not sacrifice the number of in play objects and preserve the current game experience.

 * *Contingency Plan:* If lowering the graphics quality does not resolve the slowness, we will have to reduce the number of in play objects.

 * *Status:* We have not yet encountered the issue, but are prepared to deal with slowness should it come up.
