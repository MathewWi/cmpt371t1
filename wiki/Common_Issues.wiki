_List of common issues, and how to solve them_

= Javac compiler not found =

*Syntax of error:*

projectFilepath/build.xml:76: Unable to find a javac
compiler;
com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath.
Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK

==Fixes:==
*1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK on your machine.*

In Windows:
 - Click Start, right-click on Computer and select Properties

 - Click Advanced System Settings, then Environment Variables in the window that pops up.

 - In the System Variables box, find the JAVA_HOME variable and click edit.  If there is not a variable named this, create a new one.

 - Set the value to be the path to your JDK.  For example: C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.6.0_23/bin

In Linux:
 - Open a terminal and execute the export command.  

 For example: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java

*2. Add an tools.jar to classpath.*

_note that although this works, it has not been confirmed it's a legitimate, perfect fix._

 - In eclipse, click Window->Preferences. 

 - In the resulting window on the left hand side, click Ant->Runtime.

 - Add an external JAR. Add <your JDK directory>/lib/tools.jar
